WE FIX IT. FAST.
Within 48 hours of signing up we get to work - optimising your profiles, fixing gaps, adding keywords, refreshing photos, and setting up your review strategy from day one.

Every month you get a clear, honest report. We talk you through it, flag what we're doing next, and keep pushing to improve your numbers month after month.

OUR STORY
WE BUILT HAYLO BECAUSE GREAT BUSINESSES DESERVE TO BE FOUND.
Haylo was built for one reason - too many great local businesses on the Sunshine Coast are invisible online. Cleaners, tradies and service providers doing excellent work but losing jobs to competitors who simply show up higher on Google. We fix that with practical, no-jargon improvements to your Google presence so your phone rings more often.
🎯
100% LOCAL FOCUS
We only work with Sunshine Coast businesses - cleaners, trades and service providers. We know the suburbs, the competition, and what actually gets results here.
📞
CALLS ARE OUR OBSESSION
We don't measure likes or impressions. We measure customers picking up the phone to call you - that's it.
🤝
NO LOCK-IN CONTRACTS
We earn your business month after month. Stay because it's working - not because you signed a contract.
FAQ
QUESTIONS WE GET A LOT.
Can't find what you need? Book a free call and ask us directly.
HOW QUICKLY WILL I SEE RESULTS?
+
Most clients see measurable changes - more views, clicks, and calls - within 4–8 weeks. Some see improvements within the first 2 weeks. Google and Facebook both respond quickly when profiles are properly optimised and actively maintained.
IS THERE A LOCK-IN CONTRACT?
+
Never. All plans are month-to-month. Results are what keeps you - not fine print. That said, give us 90 days. Local marketing compounds over time, and the businesses that see the biggest results stay consistent.
WHAT KINDS OF BUSINESSES DO YOU WORK WITH?
+
Trades, health & beauty, hospitality, home services, professional services, fitness - essentially any local business where a customer picks up the phone to book or enquire. If locals need to find you, we can help.
I ALREADY HAVE A GOOGLE PROFILE. CAN YOU STILL HELP?
+
Absolutely - this is where we find the biggest quick wins. Most profiles are missing key categories, have inconsistent info, aren't using posts, and aren't set up to convert views into calls. Our free audit will show you exactly what's costing you.
HOW DO YOU REPORT ON RESULTS?
+
You get a clear monthly report in plain English - no jargon. It covers profile views, phone clicks, direction requests, and review stats. Growth and Dominator clients also get a monthly call to walk through results together.
WHAT DO I NEED TO GET STARTED?
+
Very little. We'll need access to your Google Business Profile and Facebook page, and some info about your business. We handle the rest. Most clients are fully onboarded within 48 hours of signing up.
